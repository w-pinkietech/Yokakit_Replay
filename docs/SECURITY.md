# Security Policy for YokaKit_Replay

## üîí Security Overview

YokaKit_Replay takes security seriously and implements comprehensive security measures aligned with our constitutional requirements. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security best practices for contributors.

## üõ°Ô∏è Constitutional Security Framework

Our security approach is grounded in constitutional principles:

- **Identity Preservation**: Protecting YokaKit branding and preventing unauthorized identity tampering
- **Historical Fidelity**: Securing PinkieIt historical data while preventing unauthorized modifications
- **Quality-First Implementation**: Implementing security as a foundational requirement, not an afterthought
- **Repository Governance**: Maintaining strict access controls and audit trails
- **Sequential Phases**: Implementing security controls appropriate to each development phase

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | Phase Status |
| ------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Phase 0.x | ‚úÖ | Active Development |
| Phase 1.x | üîÑ | Upcoming |
| Phase 2.x | üîÑ | Future |
