# Workflow Notes:
# 1. All jobs respect constitutional requirements for YokaKit identity preservation
# 2. Security scanning is comprehensive with CodeQL integration
# 3. Required status checks align with branch protection rules
# 4. Manual dispatch allows for emergency procedures
# 5. Scheduled runs ensure continuous security monitoring
# 6. Coverage and quality metrics support quality-first implementation
# 7. Constitutional compliance is verified in every run
# 8. Submodule handling preserves historical fidelity requirements
