# Constitutional compliance documentation
# This configuration ensures:
# 1. Security-first scanning with comprehensive query coverage
# 2. Identity preservation through PinkieIt reference detection
# 3. Quality-first implementation through security-and-quality queries
# 4. Historical fidelity through proper path inclusion/exclusion
# 5. Phase-appropriate security scanning for repository infrastructure
