# Dependabot configuration notes:
# 1. Each ecosystem runs on different days to spread the load
# 2. All updates target the main branch with appropriate reviewers
# 3. Constitutional compliance: Updates preserve YokaKit identity
# 4. Phase-based milestone assignment aligns with development phases
# 5. Security-sensitive updates (Docker, Terraform) include security team review
# 6. Major version updates are ignored for critical dependencies to prevent breaking changes
# 7. Open PR limits prevent overwhelming the review process
# 8. Consistent labeling enables automated issue routing and milestone tracking
