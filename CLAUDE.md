# YokaKit_Replay - Claude Code Context

## Project Overview
YokaKit_Replay is a Phase 0 GitHub repository initialization project focused on establishing comprehensive repository infrastructure with constitutional compliance for YokaKit identity preservation and PinkieIt historical fidelity replay.

## Current Status: Phase 0 GitHub Repository Infrastructure COMPLETED ✅

### Phase 0 Completion Status
- **CodeQL Submodule Exclusion**: ✅ YokaKit and pinkieit submodules excluded from analysis
- **Workflow Dependency Removal**: ✅ Laravel/PHP dependencies made optional for Phase 0
- **Infrastructure Validation**: ✅ All workflows execute without Phase 1 dependencies
- **Constitutional Compliance**: ✅ YokaKit identity preserved, audit trail maintained
- **Submodule Management**: ✅ Absolute GitHub URLs configured, .gitmodules fixed

### Technical Stack
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON for GitHub Actions workflows, Markdown for templates
- **Platform**: GitHub.com repository infrastructure
- **Security**: GitHub native tools (CodeQL, Dependabot, Secret scanning)
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions with enhanced triggers (push, PR, schedule, manual dispatch)
- **Governance**: Phase-based permissions and branch protection

### Key Components
- Enhanced CI/CD workflows with security integration
- Branch protection with quality gates (build, test, security scans, coverage, linting)
- Issue templates with constitutional compliance fields
- 7-phase milestone structure aligned with development roadmap
- Team permission management with phase-based access elevation

## Constitutional Requirements

### Critical Constraints
1. **Identity Preservation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Maintain YokaKit naming, skip PinkieIt name change commits
2. **Historical Fidelity**: Extract improvements from PinkieIt git history, apply incrementally
3. **Sequential Phases**: Strict phase sequence (0→1→2→3→4→5→6)
4. **Submodule Sync**: Update YokaKit submodule at each phase completion
5. **Audit Trail**: All commits must reference PinkieIt commit hashes

### Phase Structure
- **Phase 0**: GitHub repository initialization ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 1**: Docker Foundation & Development Environment (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Quality Infrastructure Day (1 day intensive)
- **Phase 3**: Comprehensive Testing (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Framework Modernization (Laravel 10.x + PHP 8.2) (1 week)
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Docker Optimization (1 week)
- **Phase 6**: CI/CD Integration & Final Polish (1 week)

## Security Requirements
- GitHub native security tools only (CodeQL, Dependabot, Secret scanning)
- Required status checks: build, test, security scans, coverage, linting
- Branch protection with phase-lead approval requirements
- No direct pushes to main branch, PR workflow enforced
- Security-first repository governance with audit logging

## Development Guidelines
- Follow constitutional principles for all implementations
- Maintain YokaKit identity throughout development process
- Reference PinkieIt commits for audit trail maintenance
- Phase-based team permissions with elevated access during assigned phases
- Quality-first approach with automated validation gates

## Recent Context
- **Phase 0 Completed**: GitHub repository infrastructure with constitutional compliance
- **Analysis Documentation**: Comprehensive analysis in `docs/analysis/` with 0% content overlap
- **Strategic Planning**: 4-month implementation roadmap with 85%+ success probability
- **Document Structure**: Responsibility matrix with clear authority separation
- **PinkieIt Pattern Analysis**: 189 commits of proven modernization extracted

## Analysis Documentation Structure
- **Technical Baseline**: Current YokaKit system assessment (93 PHP files, 45 migrations)
- **Strategic Master Plan**: Phase-by-phase implementation strategy with proven patterns
- **Historical Reference**: PinkieIt development timeline with GitHub commit IDs
- **Quality Assurance**: Cross-document validation with 98% accuracy verification

## GitHub Issue Management Structure
- **Label Hierarchy**: Epic → Story → Task → Constitutional (4-layer system)
- **Issue Templates**: Feature request with constitutional compliance fields
- **Milestone Structure**: Phase 0-6 with clear completion criteria
- **Workflow Management**: needs-triage → in-progress → blocked → closed

## Next Steps
- **Begin Phase 1**: Docker Foundation & Development Environment (4 weeks)
- **Follow Proven Patterns**: Apply PinkieIt 2024-07-01 Docker foundation approach
- **Structural Cleanup**: Move models from `app/Http/Requests/` to `app/Models/`
- **Maintain Constitutional Compliance**: YokaKit identity preservation throughout
