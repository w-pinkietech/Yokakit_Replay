# YokaKit_Replay - Claude Code Context

## Project Overview
YokaKit_Replay is a Phase 0 GitHub repository initialization project focused on establishing comprehensive repository infrastructure with constitutional compliance for YokaKit identity preservation and PinkieIt historical fidelity replay.

## Current Status: Phase 0 GitHub Repository Infrastructure COMPLETED ✅

### Phase 0 Completion Status
- **CodeQL Submodule Exclusion**: ✅ YokaKit and pinkieit submodules excluded from analysis
- **Workflow Dependency Removal**: ✅ Laravel/PHP dependencies made optional for Phase 0
- **Infrastructure Validation**: ✅ All workflows execute without Phase 1 dependencies
- **Constitutional Compliance**: ✅ YokaKit identity preserved, audit trail maintained
- **Submodule Management**: ✅ Absolute GitHub URLs configured, .gitmodules fixed

### Technical Stack
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON for GitHub Actions workflows, Markdown for templates
- **Platform**: GitHub.com repository infrastructure
- **Security**: GitHub native tools (CodeQL, Dependabot, Secret scanning)
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions with enhanced triggers (push, PR, schedule, manual dispatch)
- **Governance**: Phase-based permissions and branch protection

### Key Components
- Enhanced CI/CD workflows with security integration
- Branch protection with quality gates (build, test, security scans, coverage, linting)
- Issue templates with constitutional compliance fields
- 6-phase milestone structure aligned with development roadmap
- Team permission management with phase-based access elevation

## Constitutional Requirements

### Critical Constraints
1. **Identity Preservation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Maintain YokaKit naming, skip PinkieIt name change commits
2. **Historical Fidelity**: Extract improvements from PinkieIt git history, apply incrementally
3. **Sequential Phases**: Strict phase sequence (0→1→2→3→4→5)
4. **Submodule Sync**: Update YokaKit submodule at each phase completion
5. **Audit Trail**: All commits must reference PinkieIt commit hashes

### Phase Structure
- **Phase 0**: GitHub repository initialization (current)
- **Phase 1**: Docker + Laravel 10.x upgrade
- **Phase 2**: CI/CD pipeline construction
- **Phase 3**: Testing & Quality framework
- **Phase 4**: WebSocket & MQTT modernization
- **Phase 5**: Security & Performance optimization

```

## Security Requirements
- GitHub native security tools only (CodeQL, Dependabot, Secret scanning)
- Required status checks: build, test, security scans, coverage, linting
- Branch protection with phase-lead approval requirements
- No direct pushes to main branch, PR workflow enforced
- Security-first repository governance with audit logging

## Development Guidelines
- Follow constitutional principles for all implementations
- Maintain YokaKit identity throughout development process
- Reference PinkieIt commits for audit trail maintenance
- Phase-based team permissions with elevated access during assigned phases
- Quality-first approach with automated validation gates

## Recent Context
- Feature specification created with 5 clarifications resolved
- Implementation plan completed with constitutional compliance verification
- Technical research finalized GitHub Actions and security tool integration
- Data model defines branch protection, workflows, templates, permissions
- Quickstart guide provides 5-minute setup validation procedure

## Next Steps
- Execute `/tasks` command to generate detailed implementation tasks
- Implement repository infrastructure following quickstart guide
- Validate security scanning and branch protection effectiveness
- Advance to Phase 1 upon successful Phase 0 completion
