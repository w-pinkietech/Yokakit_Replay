description: Analyze PinkieIt commit range and create initial phase specification for replay
---

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

Expected format: "Phase {N}: {start_commit}..{end_commit} - {description}"
Example: "Phase 2: 13b40d1..a1b2c3d - Quality Infrastructure Day"

## Workflow for Commit-Based Replay

Given the phase description and commit range, do this:

### 1. Parse Input

Extract from arguments:
- Phase number (e.g., "2")
- Start commit hash (e.g., "13b40d1")
- End commit hash (e.g., "a1b2c3d")
- Phase name/description (e.g., "Quality Infrastructure Day")

### 2. Analyze PinkieIt Commit Range

Navigate to PinkieIt submodule and analyze commits:

```bash
cd pinkieit
git log --oneline --reverse {start_commit}..{end_commit}
```

For **each commit** in the range:
- Run `git show {hash} --stat` to see files changed
- Run `git show {hash}` to see actual changes
- Extract:
  - Commit hash (full and short)
  - Commit date
  - Commit message
  - Files changed (count and list)
  - Purpose/intent of the commit
  - YokaKit naming adaptations needed (pinkieit ‚Üí yokakit, PinkieIt ‚Üí YokaKit)

### 3. Identify Constitutional Issues

For each commit, check if it requires constitutional handling:
- **Rename commits**: YokaKit ‚Üí PinkieIt name changes ‚Üí **SKIP**
- **Branding commits**: Logo, copyright changes ‚Üí **ADAPT** with YokaKit branding
- **Identity commits**: Database name changes ‚Üí **PRESERVE** YokaKit identity

Document all constitutional skips and adaptations.

### 4. Create Phase Directory Structure

Run the setup script:
```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "Phase {N}: {phase-name}"
```

Parse JSON output for:
- BRANCH_NAME (e.g., "003-phase-2-quality-infrastructure")
- SPEC_FILE (absolute path to spec.md)
- SPECS_DIR (absolute path to specs directory)

### 5. Generate Initial spec.md

**IMPORTANT**: Follow `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` structure with Phase-specific adaptations.

Write to SPEC_FILE using this structure:

```markdown
# Feature Specification: Phase {N} {Phase Name}

**Feature Branch**: `{branch_name}`
**Created**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase {N}: {start_commit}..{end_commit} - {description}"

## Execution Flow (main)
```text
1. Parse PinkieIt commit range from Input
   ‚Üí Range: {start_commit}..{end_commit} ({count} commits)
2. Analyze each commit for technical changes
   ‚Üí Identify: files changed, purpose, YokaKit adaptations
3. Identify constitutional issues:
   ‚Üí Rename commits: SKIP
   ‚Üí Branding commits: ADAPT with YokaKit naming
4. Extract user scenarios from commit deliverables
   ‚Üí Developer workflow improvements
5. Generate functional requirements from commits
   ‚Üí Each requirement maps to commit deliverable
6. Identify key entities (infrastructure/code components)
7. Run constitutional compliance check
   ‚Üí Verify: Identity preservation, historical fidelity
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT optimizations/features achieve and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid specific implementation (defer to /plan and /tasks)
- üë• Written for technical stakeholders understanding replay methodology

### PinkieIt Commit Range
**Start**: `{full_start_hash}` ({start_date})
**End**: `{full_end_hash}` ({end_date})
**Total Commits**: {count}
**Estimated Duration**: {duration based on timestamps}

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a YokaKit developer, I need {phase_goal} so that {benefit}, following proven patterns from PinkieIt's {phase_name} phase.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** {precondition from Phase N-1}, **When** {Phase N changes applied}, **Then** {observable outcome from commits}
2. **Given** {development workflow}, **When** {feature from commits used}, **Then** {improved capability}
{Add more scenarios based on actual commit deliverables}

### Edge Cases
- What happens when {edge_case_from_commits}?
- How does system handle {failure_scenario}?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**From Commit {hash1} ({description})**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST {specific capability from commit}
- **FR-002**: System MUST {another capability from commit}

**From Commit {hash2} ({description})**:
- **FR-003**: System MUST {capability}

{Continue for all commits}

**Constitutional Requirements**:
- **FR-{N}**: System MUST replace all "PinkieIt" references with "YokaKit"
- **FR-{N+1}**: System MUST use "yokakit" prefix for all naming
- **FR-{N+2}**: System MUST preserve YokaKit identity

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **{Entity1 from commits}**: {Description of component/infrastructure}
- **{Entity2 from commits}**: {Description with YokaKit-specific details}

---

## PinkieIt Commit References *(for implementation context)*

{For each commit:}
### Commit {N}: {short_hash}
**Message**: {message}
**Files**: {file list or count}
**Constitutional**: {SKIP/ADAPT/Direct replay} - {reason if applicable}

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [ ] No implementation details beyond commit-level descriptions
- [ ] Focused on {phase_type} value and improvements
- [ ] Written for technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all commits verified)
- [ ] Requirements testable against commit deliverables
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Scope clearly bounded ({count} commits, {duration})
- [ ] Dependencies identified (Phase {N-1})

### Constitutional Compliance
- [ ] Identity Preservation: YokaKit naming documented
- [ ] Historical Fidelity: All commits from PinkieIt verified
- [ ] Audit Trail: Full commit hashes referenced
- [ ] Constitutional skips/adaptations documented

---

## Execution Status
*Updated by main() during processing*

- [ ] PinkieIt commit range parsed
- [ ] {count} commits analyzed with git show
- [ ] Constitutional adaptations identified
- [ ] User scenarios defined from developer workflow
- [ ] Requirements generated from commit deliverables
- [ ] Entities identified
- [ ] Review checklist passed

---

## Next Steps

1. Run `/clarify` to verify commit range accuracy and constitutional compliance
2. Run `/plan` to generate commit-based implementation plan
3. Run `/tasks` to create commit-by-commit task breakdown

---

**Constitution Version**: {version from .specify/memory/constitution.md}
**PinkieIt Commit Range**: {start_commit}..{end_commit}
**Phase Dependencies**: Phase {N-1}
```

### 6. Validation Checks

Before completing:
- [ ] All commits in range analyzed (verified with `git log`)
- [ ] Constitutional skips identified and documented
- [ ] YokaKit adaptations listed for each applicable commit
- [ ] No assumptions made (all info from actual git commits)
- [ ] Commit hashes verified (full 40-character hashes)

### 7. Report Completion

Output to user:
```
‚úÖ Phase {N} specification initialized

Branch: {BRANCH_NAME}
Spec File: {SPEC_FILE}
Commits Analyzed: {count}
Constitutional Skips: {count}
YokaKit Adaptations: {count}

Next: Run /clarify to verify commit range accuracy and constitutional compliance
```

## Critical Requirements

**DO NOT**:
- Assume features that aren't in actual commits
- Include tasks/features from other phases
- Skip commit verification steps
- Guess at commit purposes without checking actual diffs

**ALWAYS**:
- Checkout PinkieIt at each commit to verify changes
- Use `git show {hash}` to see actual file changes
- Document constitutional skips with specific reasons
- Reference full 40-character commit hashes
- Base all information on actual git history
