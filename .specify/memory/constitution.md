# YokaKit_Replay Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Historical Fidelity Replay
Every improvement MUST be extracted from PinkieIt's git history and applied incrementally to YokaKit. Development follows the exact sequence of commits from PinkieIt repository, maintaining the chronological order of enhancements. Each phase implementation MUST reference specific PinkieIt commit hashes to ensure traceability and reproducibility of the improvement workflow.

### II. Submodule Synchronization Management
Each development phase completion MUST trigger YokaKit submodule updates and commit point management. Submodule state MUST be synchronized with the corresponding development milestone. All phase transitions require explicit submodule version updates to maintain alignment between the main project and YokaKit evolution state.

### III. Identity Preservation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
YokaKit name MUST be maintained throughout the entire development process. The PinkieIt name change commit (643414f) MUST be skipped during replay. All feature additions and improvements MUST protect existing YokaKit functionality. No breaking changes to core YokaKit identity or established interfaces are permitted.

### IV. Sequential Modernization Phases
Development MUST follow the strict phase sequence: Phase 0 (GitHub initialization) → Phase 1 (Docker Foundation) → Phase 2 (Docker Architecture Optimization) → Phase 3 (Comprehensive Testing) → Phase 4 (DevContainer & Framework Modernization) → Phase 5 (Advanced Docker Optimization) → Phase 6 (CI/CD Integration & Final Polish). Each phase MUST be completed before advancing to the next phase.

### V. Quality-First Implementation
Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and static code analysis MUST be introduced incrementally across phases. Each quality improvement MUST be validated through functional testing before submodule updates. Quality gates prevent advancement to subsequent phases until current phase quality standards are met.

### VI. GitHub Workflow Management
Branch strategy MUST align with phase-based development workflow. Each phase requires dedicated feature branches with mandatory pull request reviews before main branch integration. Branch naming convention MUST follow `phase-{N}-{feature-name}` pattern. All commits MUST reference corresponding PinkieIt commit hashes for audit trail maintenance. GitHub Issues MUST follow Epic → Story → Task hierarchy with constitutional compliance labeling.

### VII. Repository Governance
Security-first repository access controls MUST be enforced with branch protection rules, required status checks, and administrator review requirements. Repository settings MUST prevent direct pushes to main branch. All sensitive operations require two-factor authentication and audit logging for compliance monitoring.

### VIII. Project Management Integration
Issues and milestones MUST be aligned with development phases for progress tracking. Each phase completion requires milestone closure and issue resolution verification. GitHub project boards MUST reflect current phase status and remaining tasks. Automated workflows MUST update project status based on pull request and issue state changes. All Issues MUST be categorized using the 4-layer label hierarchy (Epic/Story/Task/Constitutional) with mandatory constitutional compliance verification.

### IX. GitHub Issue Management Hierarchy
GitHub Issues MUST follow a strict 4-layer hierarchy: Epic (Phase-level, 4-16 weeks) → Story (feature groups, 3-10 days) → Task (concrete work, 0.5-3 days) → Constitutional (compliance requirements, all durations). Each Issue level MUST have appropriate scope, timeline, and deliverables. Epic Issues MUST map 1:1 with Phase milestones. Story Issues MUST provide user value and contain multiple Tasks. Task Issues MUST be concrete, measurable, and assignable to individuals.

### X. Constitutional Label Requirements
All GitHub Issues MUST include appropriate constitutional compliance labels. The `constitutional:identity-preservation` label is NON-NEGOTIABLE and MUST be applied to all Issues affecting YokaKit core functionality. Issues involving PinkieIt pattern replay MUST include `constitutional:historical-fidelity` label. Quality-related Issues MUST include `constitutional:quality-first` label. General constitutional compliance MUST be verified with `constitutional:compliance` label. Issue creation without constitutional labeling is prohibited.

## Development Workflow

### Phase Execution Rules
- Phase 0: GitHub repository initialization with proper submodule setup
- Phase 1: Docker Foundation (2-3 weeks, commit-based replay)
- Phase 2: Docker Architecture Optimization (4-6 hours, 4 commits)
- Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (2 weeks)
- Phase 4: DevContainer & Framework Modernization (1-2 weeks)
- Phase 5: Advanced Docker Optimization (1 week)
- Phase 6: CI/CD Integration & Final Polish (1 week)

### Reference Management
All development decisions MUST reference specific PinkieIt commit hashes for audit trail maintenance. PinkieIt serves as reference repository only; YokaKit remains the primary improvement target. Commit references enable precise tracking of improvement workflow execution and facilitate rollback procedures if needed.

## GitHub Integration

### Branch Strategy
Main branch MUST remain stable with all changes introduced through phase-specific feature branches. Branch protection rules MUST require pull request reviews, status checks, and administrator approval for main branch merges. Feature branches MUST be deleted after successful integration to maintain repository cleanliness.

### Pull Request Requirements
All pull requests MUST include phase reference, PinkieIt commit hash citations, functional testing results, and submodule impact assessment. Pull request descriptions MUST document constitutional compliance verification. Automated checks MUST validate code quality, security scanning, and test coverage before review approval.

### Issue Management
Issues MUST be categorized by development phase and linked to corresponding milestones using Epic/Story/Task hierarchy. Bug reports require phase impact assessment and regression testing verification. Feature requests MUST align with historical fidelity replay principles and reference corresponding PinkieIt functionality. All Issues MUST include constitutional compliance labels with `constitutional:identity-preservation` as NON-NEGOTIABLE requirement.

## Security-First Repository Governance

### Access Control
Repository access MUST follow principle of least privilege with role-based permissions. Admin access limited to project maintainers with audit logging enabled. Collaborator access requires justification and time-bound approval for temporary contributors.

### Submodule Version Control
Submodule references MUST be pinned to specific commit hashes rather than branch references. Submodule updates require explicit approval through pull request process with impact assessment. Automated submodule update prevention protects against unauthorized dependency modifications.

### Audit Trail
All repository activities MUST maintain comprehensive audit logs including branch operations, permission changes, and security events. Weekly security scanning required with vulnerability assessment reports. Compliance monitoring ensures adherence to constitutional principles and security standards.

## Governance

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase completion requires functional testing validation AND mandatory submodule updates. Phase progression is blocked until both criteria are satisfied. Functional testing MUST verify that all phase objectives are met without regression in existing functionality.

### Change Control
Breaking changes to existing YokaKit functionality are strictly prohibited. All modifications MUST be additive or enhancement-based. PinkieIt commit references MUST be maintained for all improvement implementations to ensure workflow traceability and enable future audit requirements.

### Quality Assurance
Constitution compliance verification is required before phase advancement. All implementations MUST align with the core principles. Deviation from constitutional requirements requires explicit justification and project stakeholder approval before proceeding.

### Amendment Process
Constitutional amendments require unanimous stakeholder agreement and impact assessment across all development phases. Version control follows semantic versioning with MAJOR changes requiring migration planning. All amendments MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing governance structures.
