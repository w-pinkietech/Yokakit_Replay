# Phase 5: Multi-Architecture Docker Support

**Feature Branch**: `006-phase-5-multi`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Phase 5: Multi-Architecture Docker Support - Implement cross-platform Docker builds for AMD64 and ARM64 architectures using Docker Buildx, following PinkieIt commit 9bfa0b555b94e14a3b55a2a8d8f205486432a027.

## Overview

Phase 5 enhances YokaKit's Docker infrastructure with multi-architecture support for cross-platform deployment across AMD64 (Intel/AMD servers) and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) architectures. This phase builds upon the multi-stage Dockerfile consolidation completed in Phase 2, adding Docker Buildx integration and concurrent build optimizations while maintaining 100% functionality across all platforms.

## PinkieIt Reference Commit Analysis

### Commit 1: 9bfa0b5 (2025-06-26)
**Full Hash**: `9bfa0b555b94e14a3b55a2a8d8f205486432a027`
**Message**: Phase 3: Implement multi-architecture Docker support for Issue #69
**Files Changed**: 2 files

**Key Changes**:

**1. Dockerfile Enhancements** (29 lines changed):
- **Multi-Architecture Cache Optimization**:
  - Changed `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt` → `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt,sharing=locked`
  - Changed `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/lib/apt` → `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/lib/apt,sharing=locked`
  - Purpose: Enable concurrent builds across different architectures without cache conflicts

- **Improved Package Installation**:
  - Added `rm -f /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/docker-clean` before apt operations
  - Changed `apt-get install -y` → `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends`
  - Added `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` cleanup after package installation
  - Split package installation into two stages (build-essential/curl/ca-certificates first, then libraries)
  - Purpose: Reduce image size and improve multi-architecture build consistency

- **Additional Dependencies**:
  - Added `ca-certificates` package for secure HTTPS operations
  - Added explicit `apt-get update` after Node.js repository setup

- **Applied to Both Stages**:
  - Base stage (system dependencies)
  - Development stage (dev tools and PCOV)

**2. CLAUDE.md Documentation** (20 lines added):
- **New Section**: "Phase 3 Complete: Multi-Architecture Support (2025-06-26)"
- **Architecture Updates**:
  - Added "Multi-Architecture Support: Linux AMD64 and ARM64 builds via Docker Buildx" to architecture description
  - Added "Cross-platform builds for AMD64 and ARM64 (Apple Silicon, servers)" to improvements
  - Added "Cross-platform compatibility: Apple Silicon Macs and Intel/AMD servers supported natively" to performance

- **Build Commands Documentation** (NEW section):
  ```bash
  # Multi-architecture builds (Phase 3 - Issue #69)
  ./build-multiarch.sh production pinkieit:latest        # Build for AMD64 + ARM64
  ./build-multiarch.sh development pinkieit:dev          # Build dev stage multi-arch
  docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --target production .  # Manual multi-arch

  # Platform-specific builds
  docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --target production --load -t pinkieit:amd64 .
  docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 --target production --load -t pinkieit:arm64 .
  ```

- **Verification Checklist Additions**:
  - "Multi-architecture support: AMD64 and ARM64 builds complete successfully"
  - "Cross-platform functionality: PHP and Laravel work correctly on both architectures"

**YokaKit Adaptations Required**:
- `pinkieit:latest` → `yokakit:latest` (image names in build commands)
- `pinkieit:dev` → `yokakit:dev` (development image names)
- `pinkieit:amd64` → `yokakit:amd64` (platform-specific tags)
- `pinkieit:arm64` → `yokakit:arm64` (platform-specific tags)
- File path: `CLAUDE.md` exists in YokaKit_Replay, not in YokaKit submodule (documentation location differs)

---

## Constitutional Handling

### Commits to Skip

**None** - This single commit contains only technical Docker optimizations with no YokaKit→PinkieIt renaming.

### Commits Requiring Adaptation

**Commit 9bfa0b5**: Replace all PinkieIt naming with YokaKit in documentation

**Required Naming Changes**:
- CLAUDE.md build commands: `pinkieit` → `yokakit` (all image tags and references)
- Note: YokaKit's CLAUDE.md is in YokaKit_Replay root, not in YokaKit submodule (different location from PinkieIt)

---

## Initial Scope Analysis

### Features Identified (from commit 9bfa0b5)

**1. Multi-Architecture Build Support**:
- Docker Buildx integration for AMD64 and ARM64 platforms
- Concurrent build cache optimization with `sharing=locked`
- Platform-specific build commands and scripts

**2. Dockerfile Optimizations**:
- Enhanced cache mount configuration for parallel builds
- Improved package installation with `--no-install-recommends`
- Proper apt cache cleanup with `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`
- Additional `ca-certificates` dependency for secure operations

**3. Documentation Updates**:
- Multi-architecture build command examples
- Platform-specific build instructions
- Cross-platform verification checklist

### Files Affected (unique files across commit)

**Docker Infrastructure**: 1 file
- `Dockerfile` (29 lines changed)

**Documentation**: 1 file
- `CLAUDE.md` (20 lines added) - **Note**: Located in YokaKit_Replay root for YokaKit

### Dependencies

**From Phase 2** (Completed ✅):

- BuildKit cache mount infrastructure
- Docker Compose v2 configuration

**From Phase 4** (Completed ✅):

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

Developers can build and deploy YokaKit Docker images on both Intel/AMD servers (AMD64) and Apple Silicon Macs (ARM64) with identical functionality and performance characteristics, enabling seamless cross-platform development and deployment workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer on Apple Silicon Mac M1/M2/M3, **When** they build YokaKit Docker image with `docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64`, **Then** the build completes successfully with all Laravel functionality working
2. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline on AMD64 server, **When** it builds multi-architecture image with `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`, **Then** both platform images are created and tagged correctly
3. **Given** a YokaKit Docker image built on AMD64, **When** deployed to ARM64 host, **Then** Docker automatically selects the correct architecture-specific layer
4. **Given** concurrent multi-architecture builds, **When** using `sharing=locked` cache mounts, **Then** builds complete without cache conflicts or corruption

### Edge Cases

- What happens when building on unsupported architecture? → Buildx uses QEMU emulation automatically
- How does system handle missing platform-specific dependencies? → Fail early with clear error message
- What if Buildx is not installed? → Provide installation instructions in error output
- How to verify cross-platform functionality? → Run full test suite (425 tests) on both AMD64 and ARM64
