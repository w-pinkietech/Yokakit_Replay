## PinkieIt Reference Commit Analysis

### Commit: 6bb70e1 (2025-07-04)
**Full Hash**: `6bb70e13a520e2acf59905708446083d4ccf9f8e`
**Message**: Add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with multi-architecture Docker builds
**Files Changed**: 5 files

**Key Changes**:

**1. `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` (180 lines added)**:
- **Multi-Architecture Build Workflow**:
  - Trigger conditions: manual (workflow_dispatch), push to main, pull requests
  - Matrix strategy: production + development environments
  - Platform targets: linux/amd64, linux/arm64
  - GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) integration
  - Docker Buildx setup with multi-platform support

- **Build Configuration**:
  - Cache strategy: GitHub Actions cache (type=gha) with environment scope
  - Metadata extraction with docker/metadata-action@v5
  - Conditional push: PRs build only, main pushes to registry
  - Tags: branch-based, PR-based, SHA-based, latest-{environment}

- **Test Integration** (for PRs):
  - Runs after successful build
  - Validates Docker image functionality
  - Ensures quality gates before merge

**2. `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` (91 lines added)**:
- **Registry Publishing Workflow**:
  - Trigger: manual (workflow_dispatch), push to main, version tags (v*)
  - Manual control: production / development / both environments
  - Multi-architecture image publishing
  - Optimized for release workflows

- **Publishing Strategy**:
  - Conditional environment selection based on input
  - Automatic production builds on tag pushes
  - Both environments on "both" selection
  - Complete registry metadata management

**3. `.github/workflows/cache-cleanup.yml` (49 lines added)**:
- **Automated Cache Management**:
  - Schedule: Weekly on Sundays at 2 AM UTC (cron: '0 2 * * 0')
  - Manual execution support (workflow_dispatch)
  - GitHub API integration for cache operations

- **Cleanup Logic**:
  - Deletes caches older than 7 days (604800 seconds)
  - Reports cache usage statistics
  - Prevents cache storage bloat
  - Improves build performance through cache hygiene

**4. `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml.disabled` (42 lines removed)**:
- Removed disabled legacy workflow
- Replaced with new comprehensive docker-publish.yml
- Clean transition from old to new pipeline

**5. `CLAUDE.md` (61 lines added, 139 lines removed)**:
- Updated architecture documentation
- Added Phase 3 multi-architecture completion notes
- Simplified and reorganized CI/CD documentation
- **PinkieIt-specific content**: Build command examples reference pinkieit images

**YokaKit Adaptations Required**:
- `pinkieit` → `yokakit` (all image names in workflows)
- `w-pinkietech/pinkieit` → `w-pinkietech/YokaKit` (GitHub repository references)
- CLAUDE.md updates apply to YokaKit_Replay/CLAUDE.md (different location)
- No docker-publish.yml.disabled in YokaKit (skip removal)

## Constitutional Handling

### Commits to Skip

**None** - This single commit contains only technical CI/CD automation with naming adaptations.

### Commits Requiring Adaptation

**Commit 6bb70e1**: Replace all PinkieIt naming with YokaKit in workflows and documentation

**Required Naming Changes**:
- Workflow image references: `pinkieit` → `yokakit`
- Repository paths: `w-pinkietech/pinkieit` → `w-pinkietech/YokaKit`
- Registry tags: All pinkieit-based tags → yokakit-based tags
- Documentation: CLAUDE.md location differs (YokaKit_Replay root, not YokaKit submodule)

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

DevOps engineers can automate YokaKit Docker image builds and deployments through GitHub Actions workflows, supporting both AMD64 and ARM64 platforms with automated testing, registry publishing, and cache lifecycle management for production-ready CI/CD pipelines.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer pushes code to main branch, **When** Dockerfile is modified, **Then** docker-build.yml automatically builds multi-arch images for both production and development
2. **Given** a pull request updates application code, **When** PR is opened, **Then** docker-build.yml builds images and runs tests without publishing
3. **Given** a release manager tags version v1.0.0, **When** tag is pushed, **Then** docker-publish.yml publishes production images to ghcr.io
4. **Given** cache storage exceeds optimal size, **When** weekly cleanup runs, **Then** caches older than 7 days are deleted and usage reported

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multi-arch build fails on ARM64? → Workflow fails with clear error, no partial publish
- How does system handle registry authentication failures? → docker/login-action fails early with credentials error
- What if cache cleanup deletes active caches? → Only deletes caches >7 days old, active builds unaffected
- How to verify workflow changes before merge? → Pull request triggers build workflow without registry push
