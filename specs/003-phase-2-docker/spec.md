# Feature Specification: Phase 2 Docker Architecture Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `003-phase-2-docker`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase 2: b980f1e..08ac389 - Docker Architecture Optimization - Multi-stage Dockerfile consolidation, BuildKit cache optimization, and production-ready Docker architecture based on PinkieIt proven patterns"

## Execution Flow (main)
```text
1. Parse PinkieIt commit range from Input
   ‚Üí Range: b980f1e..08ac389 (4 commits)
2. Analyze each commit for technical changes
   ‚Üí Identify: files changed, purpose, YokaKit adaptations
3. Identify constitutional issues:
   ‚Üí Rename commits: SKIP
   ‚Üí Branding commits: ADAPT with YokaKit naming
4. Extract user scenarios from commit deliverables
   ‚Üí Developer workflow improvements
5. Generate functional requirements from commits
   ‚Üí Each requirement maps to commit deliverable
6. Identify key entities (Docker infrastructure)
7. Run constitutional compliance check
   ‚Üí Verify: Identity preservation, historical fidelity
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a YokaKit developer, I need optimized Docker build and deployment infrastructure so that development iterations are faster and production deployments are more efficient, following proven patterns from PinkieIt's Docker optimization phase.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Phase 1 Docker foundation (docker/base + docker/app structure), **When** Phase 2 optimization is applied, **Then** a single multi-stage Dockerfile consolidates all build logic
2. **Given** repeated Docker builds during development, **When** BuildKit cache mounts are enabled, **Then** dependency installation (composer, npm) reuses cached layers reducing build time
3. **Given** production deployment requirements, **When** multi-stage build completes, **Then** final image contains only runtime dependencies without build tools
4. **Given** Docker build context with source code, **When** .dockerignore is applied, **Then** unnecessary files (tests, docs, IDE configs) are excluded from build context
5. **Given** docker-compose.yml configuration, **When** renamed to compose.yml, **Then** follows Docker Compose v2 naming conventions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when BuildKit is not enabled in Docker daemon?
- How does the system handle missing docker/base or docker/app directories during consolidation?
- What occurs when YokaKit naming conflicts with PinkieIt references in consolidated Dockerfile?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**From Commit b980f1e (Docker Build Context Optimization)**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide .dockerignore file with 124 comprehensive ignore rules to exclude unnecessary files from Docker build context
- **FR-002**: System MUST exclude development files (node_modules, tests, IDE configs, logs) from Docker image builds
- **FR-003**: System MUST reduce build context size by ignoring Git files, temporary files, and OS-specific files

**From Commit f9340aa (Multi-Stage Dockerfile Consolidation)**:
- **FR-004**: System MUST consolidate docker/base/Dockerfile and docker/app configuration into single multi-stage Dockerfile
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement base stage with PHP 8.2-apache foundation
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement build stage for asset compilation and dependency installation
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement production stage with optimized runtime and compiled assets
- **FR-008**: System MUST rename docker-compose.yml to compose.yml following Docker Compose v2 conventions
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve YokaKit naming in all Docker configurations (yokakit-web-app, yokakit-dev containers)

**From Commit fe2acac (Build Cache Optimization)**:
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement BuildKit cache mounts for composer dependency installation
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement BuildKit cache mounts for npm dependency installation
- **FR-012**: System MUST separate dependency installation into dedicated stages for improved layer caching
- **FR-013**: System MUST distinguish between development and production build stages

**From Commit 08ac389 (Final Consolidation)**:
- **FR-014**: System MUST simplify multi-stage structure by removing redundant stages
- **FR-015**: System MUST optimize layer ordering for better Docker build caching
- **FR-016**: System MUST produce production-ready Docker image with minimal size and optimal performance
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing services (web-app, db, mqtt) from Phase 1

**Constitutional Requirements**:
- **FR-018**: System MUST replace all "PinkieIt" references with "YokaKit" in Dockerfile comments
- **FR-019**: System MUST use "yokakit" prefix for all image and container names
- **FR-020**: System MUST preserve YokaKit identity throughout Docker configuration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Multi-Stage Dockerfile**: Consolidated build configuration containing base, build, and production stages with YokaKit-specific naming
- **.dockerignore**: Build context exclusion rules file (124 lines) preventing unnecessary files from entering Docker build
- **compose.yml**: Docker Compose v2 configuration file (renamed from docker-compose.yml) orchestrating yokakit-web-app, yokakit-db, yokakit-mqtt services
- **BuildKit Cache Mounts**: Docker BuildKit feature for persistent caching of composer and npm dependencies across builds
- **Docker Build Stages**: Separated stages for base runtime (PHP 8.2-apache), dependency build (composer/npm), and production image
- **YokaKit Docker Services**: Renamed containers (yokakit-web-app, yokakit-dev) maintaining constitutional identity preservation
