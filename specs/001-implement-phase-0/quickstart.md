# Quickstart: GitHub Repository Infrastructure Setup

## Prerequisites
- Repository admin access to YokaKit_Replay
- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated
- Understanding of constitutional requirements (see `/memory/constitution.md`)

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Verify Repository State
```bash
# Check current branch and repository status
gh repo view --json name,defaultBranch,visibility
git status
git submodule status
```

### 2. Initialize Branch Protection
```bash
# Apply branch protection to main branch
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["build-and-test","security-scan-codeql","dependency-check","code-coverage","lint-validation"]}' \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"require_code_owner_reviews":true,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field allow_force_pushes=false \
  --field allow_deletions=false \
  --field required_linear_history=true
```

### 3. Create Workflow Directory Structure
```bash
# Create GitHub Actions workflow directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

# Verify structure
ls -la .github/
```

### 4. Deploy Enhanced CI/CD Workflow
```bash
# Copy enhanced workflow template
cat > .github/workflows/enhanced-ci-cd.yml << 'EOF'

```

### 6. Create Development Phase Milestones
```bash
# Create milestones for all 6 phases
phases=(
  "Phase 0: Repository Setup|GitHub repository initialization with proper submodule setup"
  "Phase 1: Docker + Laravel|Docker environment establishment and Laravel 10.x upgrade implementation"
  "Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline|CI/CD pipeline construction with automated testing integration"
  "Phase 3: Testing & Quality|Comprehensive testing framework and quality management system deployment"
  "Phase 4: WebSocket & MQTT|WebSocket and MQTT protocol modernization and optimization"
  "Phase 5: Security & Performance|Security hardening and performance optimization implementation"
)

for phase in "${phases[@]}"; do
  IFS="|" read -r title description <<< "$phase"
  gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones \
    --method POST \
    --field title="$title" \
    --field description="$description" \
    --field state="open"
  echo "Created milestone: $title"
done
```

### 7. Enable Security Scanning
```bash
# Enable Dependabot
cat > .github/dependabot.yml << 'EOF'
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5

  - package-ecosystem: "composer"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
EOF

# Enable secret scanning and CodeQL (requires admin access)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo \
  --method PATCH \
  --field security_and_analysis='{"secret_scanning":{"status":"enabled"},"secret_scanning_push_protection":{"status":"enabled"}}'

echo "Security scanning enabled"
```

## Validation Checklist

### Repository Configuration
- [ ] Branch protection rules applied to main branch
- [ ] Required status checks configured (5 checks minimum)
- [ ] Pull request reviews required (1 minimum, phase-lead approval)
- [ ] Force pushes and deletions disabled
- [ ] Linear history enforced

### Automation Setup
- [ ] Enhanced CI/CD workflow deployed (`.github/workflows/enhanced-ci-cd.yml`)
- [ ] Workflow triggers configured (push, PR, schedule, manual dispatch)
- [ ] Security scanning integrated (CodeQL, Dependabot, Secret scanning)
- [ ] Status checks defined and functional

### Issue Management
- [ ] Bug report template created (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`)
- [ ] Feature request template created (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml`)
- [ ] Templates include phase-based routing
- [ ] Constitutional compliance checkboxes included

### Phase Structure
- [ ] 6 development phase milestones created
- [ ] Milestone descriptions align with constitutional phases
- [ ] Phase numbering follows sequential order
- [ ] Milestone due dates configured (if applicable)

### Security Compliance
- [ ] Dependabot configuration deployed (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- [ ] Secret scanning enabled
- [ ] CodeQL analysis configured in workflow
- [ ] Security alerts and push protection active

## Constitutional Verification

### Identity Preservation ✅
- All templates and configurations reference "YokaKit_Replay"
- No PinkieIt branding in user-facing elements
- Submodule context preserved in documentation

### Sequential Phase Support ✅
- Milestone structure maps to 6 constitutional phases
- Branch naming pattern supports `phase-{N}-{feature}` convention
- Workflow automation respects phase boundaries

### Audit Trail ✅
- Pull request templates require PinkieIt commit references
- Branch protection ensures PR workflow compliance
- Security scanning provides audit logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Branch protection API errors**: Ensure you have admin access to the repository
2. **Workflow not triggering**: Check branch name patterns match trigger configuration
3. **Security scanning disabled**: Verify repository settings allow security features
4. **Milestone creation fails**: Check for duplicate milestone names

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Remove branch protection (if needed)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection --method DELETE

# Remove workflows
rm -rf .github/workflows/enhanced-ci-cd.yml

# Remove issue templates
rm -rf .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
```

## Next Steps
1. Test workflow execution with a sample pull request
2. Verify security scanning results
3. Configure team permissions for phase-based access
4. Proceed to `/tasks` command for detailed implementation tasks
