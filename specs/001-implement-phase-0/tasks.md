# Tasks: Phase 0 GitHub Repository Configuration via API

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-implement-phase-0/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: GitHub Actions workflows, YAML/JSON configurations, Markdown templates
2. Load design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: Branch protection, workflows, issue templates, team permissions, milestones, security scanning
   → contracts/: GitHub API schemas for branch protection, workflows, issue templates
   → research.md: GitHub Actions triggers, security tools integration, permission model
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: GitHub API access, repository label hierarchy, constitutional compliance verification
   → Configuration: Branch protection rules, security scanning, team permissions, milestones
   → Templates: Workflow validation, issue template testing, PR template integration
   → Integration: Security tools activation, status checks, milestone automation
   → Validation: Testing, compliance verification, comprehensive issue generation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different API endpoints = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → GitHub API operations = sequential due to rate limiting considerations
   → Label/milestone creation = parallel (independent entities)
   → Documentation validation = parallel (different checks)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T056, T057...) continuing from previous implementation
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Validate task completeness ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (API automation tasks ready for execution) ✓
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different API endpoints, no dependencies)
- Include exact GitHub API endpoints and file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
**Repository Infrastructure Project**: GitHub API endpoints, configuration validation, issue generation for project tracking

## Phase 3.11: GitHub API Authentication & Repository Access
- [ ] T056 Verify GitHub CLI authentication and repository admin permissions via `gh auth status`
- [ ] T057 Test GitHub API access with `gh api repos/:owner/:repo` to confirm admin rights
- [ ] T058 Validate constitutional compliance access to organization settings and team management

## Phase 3.12: Repository Label Hierarchy Creation ⚠️ PRIORITY FIRST
**CRITICAL: Label hierarchy must exist before issue creation and project tracking**
- [x] T059 [P] Create epic-level labels via `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/labels` for phase tracking
- [x] T060 [P] Create story-level labels for feature types and constitutional compliance
- [x] T061 [P] Create task-level labels for implementation granularity and priority
- [x] T062 [P] Create status labels for workflow automation (needs-triage, in-progress, blocked, completed)
- [x] T063 [P] Create constitutional compliance labels (identity-preservation, historical-fidelity, quality-first)

## Phase 3.13: Phase-Based Milestone Establishment
- [x] T064 [P] Create Phase 0 milestone via `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones` with constitutional requirements
- [x] T065 [P] Create Phase 1 milestone for Docker + Laravel implementation

## Phase 3.15: GitHub Native Security Activation ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE WORKFLOWS
**CRITICAL: Security tools must be active before workflow deployment references them**

for phase in "${phases[@]}"; do
  IFS="|" read -r title description <<< "$phase"
  gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --method POST --field title="$title" --field description="$description" --field state="open" &
done
wait
```

### Issue Generation (Launch Together)

  "Submodule Synchronization|story:integration,constitutional:historical-fidelity|Phase 0: Repository Setup"
  "Documentation Completeness|story:documentation,task:validation|Phase 0: Repository Setup"
)

for template in "${issue_templates[@]}"; do
  IFS="|" read -r title labels milestone <<< "$template"
  gh issue create --title "$title" --label "$labels" --milestone "$milestone" --body "Generated for Phase 0 project tracking" &
done
wait
```

## GitHub API Rate Limiting Considerations
- Label/milestone creation: Parallel execution with background jobs (within rate limits)
- Branch protection operations: Sequential execution with 1-second delays
- Security scanning activation: Sequential with validation steps
- Team operations: Sequential due to organization-level API limits
- Issue creation: Parallel batches of 5-10 issues to respect rate limits

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task completion*

- [x] All GitHub API endpoints have corresponding configuration tasks
- [x] All entities from data model have implementation tasks
- [x] All security tools configured before workflow testing
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different API endpoints)
- [x] Each task specifies exact GitHub API endpoint or validation procedure
- [x] Constitutional compliance verification included throughout
- [x] Phase-based permission structure implemented
- [x] Comprehensive issue generation for project tracking
