# Tasks: Phase 0 GitHub Repository Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-implement-phase-0/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: GitHub Actions workflows, YAML/JSON configurations, Markdown templates
2. Load design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: Branch protection, workflows, issue templates, team permissions, milestones, security scanning
   → contracts/: GitHub API schemas for branch protection, workflows, issue templates
   → research.md: GitHub Actions triggers, security tools integration, permission model
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: GitHub API access, repository structure, constitutional compliance verification
   → Configuration: Branch protection rules, security scanning, team permissions
   → Templates: Workflow files, issue templates, PR templates, documentation
   → Integration: Security tools, status checks, milestone automation
   → Validation: Testing, compliance verification, quickstart execution
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → GitHub API operations = sequential due to rate limiting considerations
   → Template creation = parallel (independent files)
   → Documentation = parallel (different directories)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) ✓
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Validate task completeness ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution) ✓
```

## Dependencies
**Critical Path**:
- Repository setup (T001-T005) → Branch protection (T006-T010) → Security integration (T011-T015) → Workflows (T016-T020)
- Security tools (T011-T015) must complete before workflows (T016-T020) that reference them
- Branch protection (T006-T010) blocks workflow deployment to prevent unprotected merges
- Team permissions (T026-T030) can run parallel to milestone creation (T031-T037)
- Documentation (T038-T043) can run parallel to validation (T044-T049)
- Constitutional compliance (T050-T055) requires all previous phases complete

```

## GitHub API Rate Limiting Considerations
- Branch protection operations: Sequential execution (T006-T010)
- Repository settings changes: Sequential execution with 1-second delays
- Milestone creation: Can be parallelized with background jobs
- Team operations: Sequential due to organization-level API limits
- File creation operations: Fully parallel (no API limits)
