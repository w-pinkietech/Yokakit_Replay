**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```text
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: GitHub Actions workflows, YAML/JSON configurations, Markdown templates
2. Load design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: Branch protection, workflows, issue templates, team permissions, milestones, security scanning
   → contracts/: GitHub API schemas for branch protection, workflows, issue templates

   → Label/milestone creation = parallel (independent entities)
   → Documentation validation = parallel (different checks)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T056, T057...) continuing from previous implementation
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Validate task completeness ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (API automation tasks ready for execution) ✓

## GitHub API Rate Limiting Considerations
- Label/milestone creation: Parallel execution with background jobs (within rate limits)
- Branch protection operations: Sequential execution with 1-second delays
- Security scanning activation: Sequential with validation steps
- Team operations: Sequential due to organization-level API limits
- Issue creation: Parallel batches of 5-10 issues to respect rate limits

## Validation Checklist
