# Feature Specification: Phase 0 GitHub Repository Initialization

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-phase-0`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement Phase 0 GitHub repository initialization for YokaKit_Replay project including branch protection setup, issue templates creation, milestone configuration for 6 development phases, automated workflow templates for CI/CD pipeline preparation, and comprehensive project documentation structure with proper submodule management integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What specific status checks should be required before allowing merges to the main branch? → A: CI + security + quality gates (build, test, security scans, code coverage, linting)
- Q: What team permission structure should be established for repository access? → A: Phase-based (Phase-leads have elevated access during their phase)
- Q: Which automated security scanning tools should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline? → A: GitHub native only (CodeQL, Dependabot, Secret scanning)
- Q: What are the code review requirements for pull requests? → A: Phase-lead approval + automated checks passing
- Q: What should trigger the automated GitHub Actions workflows? → A: Enhanced triggers (push, PR, scheduled scans, manual dispatch)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A project maintainer needs to establish a professional GitHub repository structure for the YokaKit_Replay project that supports collaborative development across 6 phases. They require standardized workflows, protection rules, issue management templates, and documentation structure that integrates with existing submodules (pinkieit and YokaKit) while preparing for automated CI/CD processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a newly created GitHub repository, **When** the maintainer applies Phase 0 initialization, **Then** branch protection rules are configured to prevent direct pushes to main branch
2. **Given** the repository structure is set up, **When** a contributor wants to report a bug, **Then** they can use pre-configured issue templates with appropriate fields
3. **Given** the project has 6 development phases, **When** milestones are created, **Then** each phase has a corresponding milestone with clear descriptions and timelines
4. **Given** the repository is initialized, **When** code is pushed, **Then** automated workflow templates are ready to trigger CI/CD processes
5. **Given** submodules exist in the project, **When** documentation is created, **Then** it properly references and integrates submodule management procedures
6. **Given** the documentation structure is complete, **When** new contributors join, **Then** they can easily understand project organization and contribution guidelines

### Edge Cases
- What happens when branch protection rules conflict with existing repository settings?
- How does the system handle milestone creation if some already exist?
- What occurs when submodule references become outdated or inaccessible?
- How are workflow templates handled if GitHub Actions are disabled for the repository?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST configure branch protection rules for the main branch to require pull request reviews
- **FR-002**: System MUST create standardized issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and general inquiries
- **FR-003**: System MUST establish 6 development phase milestones with clear naming and description conventions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide automated workflow templates for CI/CD pipeline preparation
- **FR-005**: System MUST create comprehensive project documentation structure including README, CONTRIBUTING, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT files
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate submodule management documentation for pinkieit and YokaKit dependencies
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure branch protection prevents force pushes and requires status checks
- **FR-008**: System MUST include pull request templates with appropriate review checklists
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide automated workflow templates using GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline preparation
- **FR-010**: System MUST define required status checks for branch protection including build, test, security scans, code coverage, and linting
- **FR-011**: System MUST establish phase-based team permissions where phase-leads have elevated repository access during their assigned development phase
- **FR-012**: System MUST configure GitHub native security scanning tools including CodeQL, Dependabot, and Secret scanning
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement code review requirements requiring phase-lead approval and all automated checks passing before merge
- **FR-014**: System MUST support automated workflow triggers including push events, pull requests, scheduled scans, and manual dispatch capabilities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Branch Protection Rule**: Configuration that enforces quality gates and review processes on protected branches with settings for required reviews, status checks, and push restrictions
- **Issue Template**: Standardized forms for different types of GitHub issues including bug reports, feature requests, and documentation requests with predefined fields and labels
- **Milestone**: Project phase markers representing development stages with associated timelines, deliverables, and completion criteria
- **Workflow Template**: Pre-configured automation scripts for CI/CD processes including build, test, and deployment stages
- **Documentation Structure**: Organized collection of project files including README, contributing guidelines, code of conduct, and submodule integration instructions
- **Submodule Reference**: Links to external dependencies (pinkieit and YokaKit) with version management and update procedures
