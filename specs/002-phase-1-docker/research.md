# Phase 0 Research: Docker Foundation & Development Environment

**Generated**: 2025-09-28
**Feature**: Phase 1 Docker Foundation & Development Environment
**Purpose**: Research findings to resolve technical decisions and clarifications

## Research Summary

This research phase analyzes proven PinkieIt patterns, YokaKit repository structure, and GitHub management requirements to establish concrete technical decisions for Phase 1 implementation.

## 1. Docker Infrastructure Patterns (PinkieIt Analysis)

### Decision: Multi-stage Dockerfile with Development/Production Targets
**Rationale**: PinkieIt commit a5d3b77 established single-stage foundation, later evolved to multi-stage in Phase 2-3. Starting with single-stage for Phase 1 foundation, ready for multi-stage evolution.

**PinkieIt Reference Pattern (commit a5d3b77ad98f34afae9ac7c6cd6be55770a4309c)**:
```dockerfile
FROM php:8.2-apache
# Basic PHP extensions: pdo_mysql, gd, mbstring, zip
# Apache mod_rewrite enabled
# MariaDB integration
# Port 18080 mapping (YokaKit will use same pattern)
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Nginx + PHP-FPM: Rejected due to PinkieIt's proven Apache success
- Alpine-based images: Rejected for Phase 1 simplicity, consider for Phase 5
- Separate database container: Adopted (follows PinkieIt compose pattern)

### Technology Stack Decisions:
- **Base Image**: `php:8.2-apache` (matches PinkieIt proven pattern)
- **Database**: MariaDB 10.11.4 (follows PinkieIt version)
- **Port Mapping**: 18080 (preserves PinkieIt pattern for YokaKit)
- **Volume Strategy**: Named volumes for database, bind mounts for development

## 2. YokaKit Repository Structure Analysis

### Decision: Incremental Model Relocation with Validation
**Rationale**: 29 files in `app/Http/Requests/` including `AndonConfig.php` model. Safe relocation preserves functionality while improving structure.

**Current YokaKit Issues Identified**:
- `AndonConfig.php` in wrong directory (should be Model, not Request)
- Laravel 9.19 → 10.x upgrade path needed
- PHP 8.0.2 → 8.2 compatibility requirements
- Missing Docker infrastructure entirely

**Relocation Strategy**:
1. Audit: Identify actual models vs request classes
2. Create: Proper `app/Models/` versions
3. Update: All references and imports
4. Validate: Functionality preservation
5. Remove: Old incorrect locations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Mass relocation: Rejected due to risk of breaking changes
- Leave as-is: Rejected due to Laravel best practices violation
- Gradual migration: Adopted for safety and validation

## 3. GitHub Management Migration (YokaKit_Replay Analysis)

### Decision: Automated Label Migration with Manual Validation
**Rationale**: YokaKit_Replay has complete 4-tier label hierarchy (18 labels) with constitutional compliance structure.

**Label Migration Approach**:
```bash
# Epic Level (6 labels) - Phase tracking
epic:phase-0 through epic:phase-6

# Story Level (5 labels) - Feature grouping
story:feature, story:security, story:ci-cd, story:integration, story:documentation

# Task Level (3 labels) - Work units
task:implementation, task:validation, task:testing

# Constitutional (4 labels) - Compliance tracking
constitutional:identity-preservation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
constitutional:historical-fidelity
constitutional:quality-first
constitutional:compliance
```

**Milestone Structure**:
- Phase 0: GitHub Repository Infrastructure ✅ (Reference completed)
- Phase 1: Docker Foundation & Development Environment (4 weeks)
- Phase 2: Quality Infrastructure Day (1 day)
- Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (2 weeks)
- Phase 4: Framework Modernization (1 week)
- Phase 5: Advanced Docker Optimization (1 week)
- Phase 6: CI/CD Integration & Final Polish (1 week)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual label creation: Rejected due to error risk and time cost
- Simplified label structure: Rejected due to constitutional requirements
- Gradual label migration: Rejected due to consistency needs

## 4. DevContainer Configuration (VS Code Integration)

### Decision: Laravel-Optimized DevContainer with Quality Tools
**Rationale**: PinkieIt development timeline shows DevContainer introduction in Feb-Mar 2025 after Docker foundation success.

**DevContainer Features**:
- PHP 8.2 + Apache + MariaDB environment
- Laravel-specific VS Code extensions
- Pre-configured debugging and hot-reload
- Quality tools: PHPUnit, Pint, Larastan
- Git integration with constitutional compliance

**Extension Requirements**:
```json
{
  "extensions": [
    "bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client",
    "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss",
    "codingyu.laravel-goto-view",
    "ryannaddy.laravel-artisan",
    "ms-vscode.vscode-json"
  ]
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Local development only: Rejected due to environment consistency needs
- GitHub Codespaces focus: Accepted as additional option
- Docker Compose only: Rejected due to developer experience gap

## 5. Quality Infrastructure Setup

### Decision: Progressive Quality Gate Implementation
**Rationale**: PinkieIt Timeline shows Quality Infrastructure Day (Jun 13, 2025) as concentrated implementation after foundation.

**Phase 1 Quality Tools**:
- **Code Formatting**: Laravel Pint (follows PinkieIt pattern)
- **Static Analysis**: Larastan/PHPStan (proven in PinkieIt)
- **Testing Framework**: PHPUnit (existing YokaKit compatibility)
- **Validation Scripts**: Constitutional compliance automation

**Quality Gate Strategy**:
1. **Immediate**: Code formatting and basic linting
2. **Phase 1 End**: Structural validation (model relocation verification)
3. **Future Phases**: Comprehensive testing, security scanning

**Constitutional Compliance Automation**:
```bash
# Validation script checks:
- YokaKit naming preservation
- Model relocation completion
- Docker configuration compliance
- PinkieIt commit hash references
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- All quality tools immediately: Rejected due to complexity overload
- No quality infrastructure: Rejected due to constitutional requirements
- External CI/CD only: Rejected due to immediate feedback needs
