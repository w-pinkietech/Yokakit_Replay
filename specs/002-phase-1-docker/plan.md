## Summary
Primary requirement: Establish comprehensive Docker-based development environment for YokaKit with structural fixes, GitHub management setup, and DevContainer integration. Technical approach: Containerized stack using PHP 8.2 + Apache + MariaDB following proven PinkieIt patterns with YokaKit identity preservation throughout.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: PHP 8.2 (upgrading from PHP 8.0.2)
**Primary Dependencies**: Laravel 10.x (upgrading from 9.19), Apache, MariaDB, Docker, Docker Compose
**Storage**: MariaDB database with persistent volumes, local file system for development
**Testing**: PHPUnit, Laravel testing suite, validation scripts
**Target Platform**: Linux containers (Docker), cross-platform development (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: web - Laravel backend application with containerized development environment
**Performance Goals**: Development environment startup < 2 minutes, hot-reload < 5 seconds
**Constraints**: YokaKit identity preservation, PinkieIt pattern compliance, constitutional requirements
**Scale/Scope**: Single developer to team development environment, 4-week implementation timeline

**User-Provided Implementation Context**:
Phase 1 Docker Foundation requires comprehensive YokaKit repository GitHub management setup before technical implementation. Reference docs/github-management/ and current YokaKit_Replay configuration to:

GITHUB PREPARATION PHASE (Pre-Week 1):
1. Label System Migration: Apply YokaKit_Replay's 4-tier label hierarchy (18 labels) to YokaKit repository using gh CLI
2. Milestone Structure Setup: Create Phase 0-6 milestones with constitutional compliance tracking
3. Issue Template Migration: Copy constitutional compliance issue templates from YokaKit_Replay/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
4. Phase 1 Epic Creation: Create '[EPIC] Phase 1: Docker Foundation & Development Environment' issue with PinkieIt reference patterns

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PHASE (Weeks 1-4):
Follow docs/analysis/timeline/pinkieit-development-timeline.md proven patterns:
- Docker Foundation (commit a5d3b77 reference) → DevContainer → Quality Infrastructure → Framework Modernization

CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- All issues must include constitutional:identity-preservation label
- Reference PinkieIt commit hashes for audit trail
- Maintain YokaKit naming throughout development process
- Apply proven patterns from PinkieIt's 189-commit modernization history

**Output**: research.md with all research findings and technology decisions

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design
Extract entities from feature specification for Docker development environment:

1. **Docker Environment Configuration**
   - Container definitions (web-app, database, cache)
   - Volume mappings for persistent data
   - Network configuration for service communication
   - Environment variable management

2. **YokaKit Application Structure**
   - Model relocation mapping (source → target paths)
   - Dependency analysis for structural changes
   - Configuration updates for containerized environment

3. **GitHub Management Structure**
   - Label hierarchy definitions (Epic/Story/Task/Constitutional)
   - Milestone configuration (Phase 0-6 mapping)
   - Issue template structure with constitutional fields

4. **Development Workflow Configuration**
   - DevContainer specifications for VS Code
   - Validation script definitions and execution flow
   - Quality gate configuration and validation rules

### Contract Generation
Generate configuration contracts from functional requirements:

1. **Docker Compose Contract**: Service definitions, networking, volumes
2. **DevContainer Contract**: VS Code configuration, extensions, settings
3. **GitHub Configuration Contract**: Labels, milestones, issue templates
4. **Validation Script Contract**: Quality checks, constitutional compliance verification

### Integration Test Scenarios
Extract test scenarios from user stories:

1. **Development Environment Setup**: Clone → Setup → Validation workflow
2. **Code Changes Workflow**: Edit → Hot-reload → Quality checks
3. **Model Relocation Verification**: Structural integrity → Functionality preservation
4. **GitHub Management Validation**: Issue creation → Label application → Milestone tracking

### Agent Context Update
Update CLAUDE.md with Phase 1 technical context:
- Docker development environment setup
- YokaKit structural improvement requirements
- Constitutional compliance integration
- PinkieIt pattern reference guidelines

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md updates

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- GitHub Preparation Phase tasks (Pre-Week 1)
- Docker Foundation tasks (Week 1-2)
- DevContainer and Quality Infrastructure tasks (Week 3-4)
- Model relocation and validation tasks (Throughout)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- GitHub setup before technical implementation
- Docker foundation before development environment
- Validation scripts throughout implementation
- Constitutional compliance verification at each milestone

**Task Categories**:
1. **GitHub Management Setup** [P] - Label migration, milestone creation, Epic issue
2. **Docker Infrastructure** [P] - Dockerfile, compose configuration, networking
3. **Development Environment** - DevContainer, VS Code integration, hot-reload
4. **Structural Improvements** - Model relocation, dependency updates
5. **Quality Infrastructure** - Validation scripts, testing, compliance checks
6. **Documentation** - Setup guides, troubleshooting, developer onboarding

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md grouped by implementation week

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

Implementation follows constitutional requirements:
- YokaKit identity preservation throughout
- PinkieIt commit hash references for audit trail
- Quality-first approach with validation gates
- Submodule synchronization at phase completion

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

All implementation approaches comply with constitutional requirements. Docker containerization enhances rather than complicates the development workflow. GitHub management setup ensures proper governance without adding unnecessary complexity.
