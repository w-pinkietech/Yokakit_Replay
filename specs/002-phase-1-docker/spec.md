# Feature Specification: Phase 1 Docker Foundation & Development Environment

**Feature Branch**: `002-phase-1-docker`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase 1 Docker Foundation & Development Environment - Docker infrastructure based on proven PinkieIt 2024-07-01 patterns with PHP 8.2 + Apache + MariaDB, Laravel integration, critical structural fixes (moving models from app/Http/Requests to app/Models), DevContainer development environment, basic quality infrastructure, validation scripts implementation at each stage, 4-week implementation plan while preserving YokaKit identity"

## Execution Flow (main)
```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a YokaKit developer, I need a consistent, containerized development environment that allows me to work on the project locally with all dependencies pre-configured, so that I can contribute effectively regardless of my local machine setup while maintaining compatibility with the existing YokaKit codebase structure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has Docker installed, **When** they clone the YokaKit_Replay repository and run the development environment setup, **Then** they should have a fully functional local development environment with PHP 8.2, Apache, and MariaDB running
2. **Given** the development environment is running, **When** a developer makes code changes to YokaKit files, **Then** changes should be immediately reflected in the running application with proper hot-reload capabilities
3. **Given** the containerized environment is active, **When** a developer runs validation scripts, **Then** they should receive clear feedback about code quality, structural integrity, and compliance with YokaKit identity preservation requirements
4. **Given** the structural fixes are applied, **When** a developer inspects the codebase, **Then** all models should be properly located in the app/Models directory rather than incorrectly placed in app/Http/Requests
5. **Given** the development environment is configured, **When** multiple developers work on the project, **Then** they should all have identical development environments ensuring consistent behavior across different machines

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a developer's local Docker version doesn't support required features?
- How does the system handle conflicts between existing local PHP installations and the containerized environment?
- What occurs when the MariaDB data volume becomes corrupted or needs to be reset?
- How does the environment behave when network connectivity is limited or unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a containerized development environment that runs consistently across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **FR-002**: System MUST include PHP 8.2 runtime environment with all necessary extensions for Laravel framework compatibility
- **FR-003**: System MUST include Apache web server configured to serve the YokaKit application with proper document root and rewrite rules
- **FR-004**: System MUST include MariaDB database server with persistent data storage for development work
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve YokaKit identity and naming conventions throughout all container configurations and scripts
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement structural fixes by relocating incorrectly placed model files from app/Http/Requests to app/Models directory
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide DevContainer configuration for VS Code integration enabling seamless development experience
- **FR-008**: System MUST include validation scripts that verify environment setup, structural integrity, and constitutional compliance
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing YokaKit codebase without breaking current functionality
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear documentation and setup instructions for developers to quickly start contributing
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement quality infrastructure including linting, code formatting, and basic testing capabilities
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure all changes maintain audit trail referencing proven PinkieIt patterns while preserving YokaKit identity
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide environment variable management for different development configurations
- **FR-014**: System MUST include database initialization and migration capabilities for fresh development setups
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement container orchestration that allows for easy start, stop, and rebuild of the entire development stack

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Docker Environment**: Containerized development stack including web server, database, and application runtime
- **YokaKit Application**: The existing Laravel-based application requiring containerization and structural fixes
- **Model Files**: PHP classes that need to be relocated from incorrect app/Http/Requests location to proper app/Models directory
- **DevContainer Configuration**: VS Code development container settings enabling integrated development experience
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated tools for verifying environment setup, code quality, and constitutional compliance
- **Database Schema**: MariaDB structure supporting YokaKit application data requirements
- **Quality Infrastructure**: Tools and configurations for code linting, formatting, and basic testing
